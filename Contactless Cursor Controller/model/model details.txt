Model details:

Dlib facial landmark detector and predictor is made using the classic Histogram of Oriented
Gradients (HOG) feature combined with a linear classifier.

The facial landmarks detector was created by using dlib's implementation of the paper:

The facial landmark predictor was trained on 68 point iBUG 300-W dataset 300 faces in-the-wild
